# 2020 Fall FORIF Algorithm study
This is a repository containing the code for algorithms studied in the study group '알뚝깨'. '알뚝깨(알고리즘 뚝배기 깨기)' has been organized to understand algorithms based on data structures and implement them in C++ or Python. 

The topics we have covered are as follows
* Basic Data Strucures: Stack, Queues etc.
* Sorting Algorithms: Insertion sort, Merge sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort
* Binary Serach
* Graph Theory: BFS, DFS, Union-find, Topological Sort, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm
* Shortest Path Algorithm: Dijkstra

Solutions for realted algorithm problems from Baekjoon Oline Judge and Programmers are also uploaded.
